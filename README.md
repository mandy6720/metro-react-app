# Metro App

## Desccription

In the DC area, our subway system is called ‚Äúthe Metro‚Äù and is run by Washington Metro Area Transit Authority or WMATA for short.

Today, we‚Äôre going to be building a project similar to something we had on screens in the WaPo office where you could see the next trains coming for a given station (the WaPo one defaulted to the closest to the office), what the expected arrival times were for each train and which direction that train was going.

How do you get that info? Great question, I‚Äôm glad you asked!

You will have to sign up for a free account at https://developer.wmata.com/

Once you create an API key, you‚Äôll need to access the APIs (particularly the Rail Station Info and Predictions ones). Note that you can play around with these api responses to see the structure of the data on the wmata site (for example, you can see the rail stations here).

## Installation

0. Make sure you have node & npm installed! You will also need yarn (run `yarn -v` to check for it. If you don't have it, run `npm i yarn -g`)
1. From the root of your project run `yarn`
2. To start up your app in dev mode, run `yarn start`
3. Give yourself a high five - you did it! üéâ

## CRA Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
